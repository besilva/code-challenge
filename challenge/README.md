## Run the project

```
cd /challenge
npm i
npm run solution

```

## Notes

There wasn't any rules/specifications about the behavior when the rover reaches the border, so I did a "switch side". It changes the rover from on side of the plateau to another. Example: rover is in 5 5 N and the user types 'M' the rover will finish at 5 0 N.
